# todo-list

## Project Description

This is a to-do list web application that allows users to add tasks and set a due date for each one. Users are able to filter tasks based on when they are due as well as add projects to organize tasks under a common goal. Users are also able to customize the color theme of their to-do list using the color picker in the upper right hand corner. A search bar is also available to allow users to find tasks quicker.

In the future I hope to implement another filter button that allows users to organize tasks based on different criteria such as: 
- A - Z alphabetical order
- Z - A alphabetical order
- Closest Due Date
- Farthest Due Date
- Task Priority 

With this project I used a barrel file to organize my imports and exports into one main file. I also made use of the PubSub pattern to ensure modules remained loosely coupled. My primary focus during this project was to ensure I followed the OOP principles as closely as possible. Following these principles made it easier to create all the necessary functions and objects used within this project.
